class AVLTree(BST):
    """ An implementation of a self-ballancing binary search tree

    The AVLTree invariant is that each node has to have a ballance factor in
    {-1, 0, 1}, whereby the ballance factor is calculated as the height of the
    left subtree minus the height of the right subtree.

    They are more rigidly ballaced than RedBlack trees which makes them better
    at lookups.

    Inventors: Georgy Adelson-Velsky and E.M. Landis in 1962.
